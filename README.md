# Autonomous Scanning Collaboration Solution within the Same Building

## SDIM Group 3 - Fall 2023 at Southern University of Science and Technology

We are Group 3 from the School of System Design and Intelligent Manufacturing (SDIM) during the Fall 2023 semester at Southern University of Science and Technology. We have proposed an autonomous scanning solution designed for collaborative operation within the same building. This solution is aimed at alleviating the physical labor burden of technical workers in construction site measurement and quantification tasks.

### Design and Functionality

In terms of appearance, we have conducted Kansei Engineering measurements and established engineering features to create a design that meets the enterprise's demands for a sense of technology and reliability. Functionally, we have broken down the requirements into four aspects: movement, scanning, scheduling, and management. We have implemented various technical solutions, including:

- A screw rail scanner lifting mechanism
- Ultra-wideband wireless communication for centimeter-level machine positioning
- UWB feedback control for following the operator's movement
- Dual-loop motion control with PID for speed and position
- Part simulation and optimization using Abaqus
- APP and physical controller design compliant with ergonomics
